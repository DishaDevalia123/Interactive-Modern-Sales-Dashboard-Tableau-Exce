# Interactive-Modern-Sales-Dashboard-Tableau-Excel
This repository contains a sales dashboard project in Tableau. The objective of this project is to leverage insights from an online superstore dataset to make informed data-driven decisions and improve sales strategies. The dataset was transformed using Excel, and data visualization was performed using Tableau.

Data Source
The data used in this project is the Superstore dataset. This dataset contains information about orders placed at an online superstore between 2014 and 2017, including details such as customer demographics, order date, product categories, sales revenue, and shipping information.

Tools Used
Excel
Tableau

Project Details
The Superstore dataset was first cleaned and transformed using Excel to ensure data accuracy and completeness. Once the dataset was ready, data visualization was performed using Tableau. The goal was to create an interactive sales dashboard that would allow stakeholders to quickly identify trends, patterns, and insights from the data.

The dashboard consists of several interactive visualizations that provide an overview of the sales performance, customer demographics, product categories, and regional sales. Some of the key insights from the dashboard include:

The total sales revenue for the four-year period was $23,761,632.
The highest sales revenue was generated in the Central region, followed by the West, East, and South regions.
Furniture was the top-selling product category, followed by Office Supplies and Technology.
The most profitable sub-category was Copiers, with a profit margin of 11.45%.
Customers in the Corporate segment generated the highest sales revenue, followed by the Consumer and Home Office segments.
Conclusion
The sales dashboard project in Tableau provides valuable insights into the online superstore dataset and can be used to make informed data-driven decisions. The dashboard can be updated regularly to track sales performance and identify opportunities for improvement.
